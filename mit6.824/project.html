<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
You can either do a final project based on your own ideas,
or <a href="labs/lab-shard.html">Lab 4</a>.

<p>
If you want to do a project, you must get our approval for your idea
in advance. You must form a group of 2 or 3 6.824 students to
collaborate on the project. At the end of the term you'll turn in your
code and a short write-up describing the design and implementation of
your project, and make a short in-class presentation about your work.
We'll post the project write-ups and code on the course web site.

<p>
Your project should be something interesting and challenging that's
closely related to 6.824 core topics, such as fault tolerance.
The project must involve at least as much effort as Lab 4.
Below
you'll find some half-baked ideas that we think could turn into
interesting projects, but we haven't given them too much thought.

<p>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>
There are four concrete steps to the final project, as follows:

<ol>

<li>
Form a group and decide on the project you would like to work on.
Feel free to use Piazza to find group members and discuss ideas.
Course staff will be happy to discuss project ideas via e-mail or in
person.

<li>
Flesh out the exact problem you
will be addressing and how you will go about solving it.
By the proposal deadline, you must
submit a proposal (less than a page) describing: your <b>group members</b>
list, <b>the problem</b> you want to address, <b>how you plan to address it</b>,
and what are you proposing to <b>specifically design and implement</b>.
Submit your proposal to
<a href="https://6824.scripts.mit.edu/2022/handin.py/">https://6824.scripts.mit.edu/2022/handin.py/</a>.
We'll tell you whether we approve, or not, and give you feedback.

<li>
Execute your project: design and build something neat!

<li>
Write a document describing the design and implementation of your project,
and turn it in along with your project's code by the final deadline.
The document should be about 3 pages of text that helps us understand what
problem you solved, and what your code does.  You can either send the code to
the staff list or provide a link to an repository (e.g., on GitHub) in your
writeup.  The code and writeups will be posted online after the end of the
semester.

<li>
Prepare a short presentation about the work that you have done for
your final project, and deliver it during the last class meeting.

</ol>

<p>
<h2>Half-baked project ideas</h2>

<p>
You should feel free to propose your own project idea. If you'd like
some starting points, here are some topics that might (or might not)
be worth thinking about.

<ul>

<li> Re-implement one of the systems described in the papers discussed in 6.824.

<li> Build a high-performance Raft implementation, changing
the design as needed.

<li> Build a distributed, decentralized, fault-tolerant Reddit.

<li> Build a system for making Node.js applications fault-tolerant,
perhaps using some form of replicated execution.

<li> Add cross-shard atomic transactions to Lab 4, using two-phase commit
and/or snapshots.

<li> Build a data-flow processing system in the style of Google FlumeJava
or Spark or Naiad.

<li> Build a system with asynchronous replication (like Dynamo or
Ficus or Bayou). Perhaps add stronger consistency (as in COPS
or Walter or Lynx).

<li> Build a file synchronizer (like
  <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">Unison</a> or
  <a href="http://swtch.com/tra/">Tra</a>).

<li> Build a coherent caching system for use by web sites (a bit
like memcached), perhaps along the lines of
<a href="http://drkp.net/papers/txcache-osdi10.pdf">TxCache</a>.

<li> Build a distributed cooperative web cache, perhaps along
the lines of
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/iptps09/tech/full_papers/terrace/terrace_html/">Firecoral</a> or
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amislove/publications/Maygh-EuroSys.pdf">Maygh</a>.

<li> Build a collaborative editor like EtherPad, using
eventually-consistent or CRDT primitives.

<li> Use a block-chain to build something other than a crypto-currency.

<li> Build a fault-tolerant and/or sharded file service.

<li> Build a
<a href="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc469h/fall/handouts/nitzberg91.pdf">distributed shared memory</a> (DSM) system, to make it possible to run existing
parallel code intended for a single multi-core machine, but on a cluster of 
machines.

<li> Build a distributed block store in the style of Amazon EBS or FAB.
Maybe you can get standard operating systems
to talk to you network virtual disk using iSCSI or
Linux's NBD (network block device).

<li> Build a geo-replicated storage system, like Dynamo or COPS,
perhaps providing something useful and/or efficient in the the way 
of transactions or consistency.

<li> Use modern high-speed NIC features (e.g. RDMA or DPDK) to build a
high-speed service, perhaps with replication or transactions.

<li> Use modern fast non-volatile storage (e.g. Intel Optane) to
simplify the design of a fault-tolerant system.

<li> Build a fault-tolerance framework that's easier than Raft to
layer service code on top of.

<li> Figure how to say something useful about whether applications
really need strictly consistent storage, or what the cost in application
complexity is of having to use storage with weak consistency.

<li> Build a data-processing system that is good at both big data
(like MapReduce and Spark) and on-line processing (like a key/value
store or SQL database).

</ul>
