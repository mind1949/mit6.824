<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In this lab you will build a fault-tolerant key/value storage
service using your Raft library from
<a href="lab-raft.html">Lab 2</a>. Your
key/value service will be a replicated state machine, consisting of
several key/value servers that use Raft for replication.
Your key/value service should continue to
process client requests as long as a majority of the servers
are alive and can communicate, in spite of other failures or
network partitions.

After Lab 3, you will have implemented all parts (Clerk, Service, and Raft) shown in the <a
    href="../notes/raft_diagram.pdf">diagram of Raft interactions</a>.

<p>
Clients can send three different RPCs to the key/value service:
<tt>Put(key, value)</tt>,
<tt>Append(key, arg)</tt>, and <tt>Get(key)</tt>. The service maintains a
simple database of key/value pairs. Keys and values are strings.
<tt>Put(key, value)</tt> replaces the value
for a particular key in the database, <tt>Append(key, arg)</tt>
appends arg to key's value, and <tt>Get(key)</tt> fetches the current
value for the key. A <tt>Get</tt> for a non-existent key should return
an empty string. An <tt>Append</tt> to a non-existent key should act
like <tt>Put</tt>. Each client talks to the service through
a <tt>Clerk</tt> with Put/Append/Get methods. A <tt>Clerk</tt> manages
RPC interactions with the servers.

<p>
Your service must arrange that application calls to <tt>Clerk</tt>
Get/Put/Append methods be linearizable. If called one at a time, the
Get/Put/Append methods should act as if the system had only one copy
of its state, and each call should observe the modifications to the
state implied by the preceding sequence of calls. For concurrent
calls, the return values and final state must be the same as if the
operations had executed one at a time in some order. Calls are
concurrent if they overlap in time: for example, if client X
calls <tt>Clerk.Put()</tt>, and client Y
calls <tt>Clerk.Append()</tt>, and then client X's call returns. A
call must observe the effects of all calls that have completed before
the call starts.

<p>
Linearizability is convenient for applications because it's the
behavior you'd see from a single server that processes requests one at
a time. For example, if one client gets a successful response from the
service for an update request, subsequently launched reads from other
clients are guaranteed to see the effects of that update. Providing
linearizability is relatively easy for a single server. It is harder
if the service is replicated, since all servers must choose the same
execution order for concurrent requests, must avoid replying to
clients using state that isn't up to date, and must recover their
state after a failure in a way that preserves all acknowledged client
updates.

<p>
This lab has two parts. In part A, you will implement a key/value
service using your Raft implementation, but without using snapshots.
In part B, you will use your snapshot implementation from Lab 2D,
which will allow Raft to discard old log entries. Please submit each
part by the respective deadline.

<p>
You should review the
<a href="../papers/raft-extended.pdf">extended Raft paper</a>,
in particular Sections 7 and 8. For a wider
perspective, have a look at Chubby, Paxos Made Live,
Spanner, Zookeeper, Harp, Viewstamped Replication, and
<a href="http://static.usenix.org/event/nsdi11/tech/full_papers/Bolosky.pdf">Bolosky et al.</a>

<p>
Start early.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
We supply you with skeleton code and tests in <tt>src/kvraft</tt>. You will
need to modify <tt>kvraft/client.go</tt>, <tt>kvraft/server.go</tt>, and
perhaps <tt>kvraft/common.go</tt>.

<p>
To get up and running, execute the following commands.
Don't forget the <tt>git pull</tt> to get the latest software.
<pre>
$ cd ~/6.824
$ git pull
...
$ cd src/kvraft
$ go test -race
...
$</pre>

<h3>Part A: Key/value service without snapshots <script>g("moderate/hard")</script></h3>

<p>
Each of your key/value servers ("kvservers") will have an associated
Raft peer. Clerks send <tt>Put()</tt>, <tt>Append()</tt>,
and <tt>Get()</tt> RPCs to the kvserver whose associated Raft is the
leader. The kvserver code submits the Put/Append/Get operation to
Raft, so that the Raft log holds a sequence of Put/Append/Get
operations. All of the kvservers execute operations from the Raft log
in order, applying the operations to their key/value databases; the
intent is for the servers to maintain identical replicas of the
key/value database.

<p>
A <tt>Clerk</tt> sometimes doesn't
know which kvserver is the Raft leader. If the <tt>Clerk</tt> sends an
RPC to the wrong kvserver, or if it cannot reach the kvserver,
the <tt>Clerk</tt> should re-try by sending to a different kvserver.
If the key/value service commits the operation to its Raft log
(and hence applies the operation to the key/value state machine), the
leader reports the result to the <tt>Clerk</tt> by responding to its
RPC. If the operation failed to commit (for example, if the leader was
replaced), the server reports an error, and the <tt>Clerk</tt> retries with a
different server.

<p>
Your kvservers should not directly communicate; they
should only interact with each other through Raft.

<div class="todo">
<p>
Your first task is to implement a solution that works when there are no dropped
messages, and no failed servers.

<p>
You'll need to add RPC-sending code to the Clerk Put/Append/Get
methods in <tt>client.go</tt>, and implement
<tt>PutAppend()</tt> and <tt>Get()</tt> RPC handlers in
<tt>server.go</tt>. These handlers should enter an
<tt>Op</tt> in the Raft log using <tt>Start()</tt>; you should fill in
the <tt>Op</tt> struct definition in <tt>server.go</tt> so that it
describes a Put/Append/Get operation. Each server should
execute <tt>Op</tt> commands as Raft commits them, i.e.
as they appear on the <tt>applyCh</tt>. An RPC handler
should notice when Raft commits its <tt>Op</tt>, and then reply to the
RPC.

<p>
You have completed this task when you
<strong>reliably</strong> pass the first test in the
test suite: "One client".
</div>

<ul class="hints">
<li>
After calling <tt>Start()</tt>, your 
kvservers will need to wait for Raft to complete
agreement. Commands that have been agreed upon arrive
on the <tt>applyCh</tt>. Your
code will need to
keep reading <tt>applyCh</tt> while
<tt>PutAppend()</tt> and <tt>Get()</tt> handlers submit
commands to the Raft log using <tt>Start()</tt>.
Beware of deadlock between the kvserver and its
Raft library.

<li>
You are allowed to add fields to the Raft <tt>ApplyMsg</tt>,
and to add fields to Raft RPCs such as <tt>AppendEntries</tt>,
however this should not be necessary for most implementations.

<li>
A kvserver should not complete a <tt>Get()</tt>
RPC if it is not part of a majority (so that it does
not serve stale data). A simple solution is to enter
every <tt>Get()</tt> (as well as each <tt>Put()</tt>
and <tt>Append()</tt>) in the Raft log. You don't have
to implement the optimization for read-only operations
that is described in Section 8.

<li>
It's best to add locking from the start because the
need to avoid deadlocks sometimes affects overall code design. Check
that your code is race-free using
<tt>go test -race</tt>.

</ul>

Now you should modify your solution to continue in the face of network
and server failures.
One problem you'll face is that a
<tt>Clerk</tt> may have to send an RPC multiple times until it finds a 
kvserver that replies positively. If a leader fails just after
committing an entry to the Raft log, the <tt>Clerk</tt> may not
receive a reply, and thus may 
re-send the request to another leader.
Each call to
<tt>Clerk.Put()</tt> or <tt>Clerk.Append()</tt> should
result in just a single execution, so you will have to ensure
that the re-send doesn't result in the servers executing
the request twice.

<p class="todo">
Add code to handle failures, and
to cope with duplicate <tt>Clerk</tt> requests, including
situations where the <tt>Clerk</tt> sends a request to a kvserver leader
in one term, times out waiting for a reply, and re-sends the
request to a new leader in another term. The request
should execute just once.
Your code should pass the <tt>go test -run 3A -race</tt> tests.

<ul class="hints">

<li>
Your solution needs to handle a
leader that has called Start() for a Clerk's
RPC, but loses its leadership before the
request is committed to the log. In this case
you should arrange for the Clerk to re-send
the request to other servers until it finds
the new leader. One way to do this is for the
server to detect that it has lost leadership,
by noticing that a different request has
appeared at the index returned by Start(), or
that Raft's term has
changed. If the ex-leader is partitioned by
itself, it won't know about new leaders; but
any client in the same partition won't be able
to talk to a new leader either, so it's OK in
this case for the server and client to wait
indefinitely until the partition heals.

<li>
You will probably have to modify your 
Clerk to remember which server turned out to
be the leader for the last RPC, and send the
next RPC to that server first. This will avoid
wasting time searching for the leader on every
RPC, which may help you pass some of the tests
quickly enough.

<li>
You will need to uniquely identify client operations to ensure that
the key/value service executes each one just once.

<li>
Your scheme for duplicate detection should free server memory quickly,
for example by having each RPC imply that the client has seen the
reply for its previous RPC. It's OK to assume that a client will make
only one call into a Clerk at a time.

</ul>

<p>
Your code should now pass the Lab 3A tests, like this:

<pre>
$ go test -run 3A -race

</pre>

<p>
The numbers after each <tt>Passed</tt> are real time in seconds,
number of peers, number of RPCs sent (including client RPCs), and
number of key/value operations executed (<tt>Clerk</tt> Get/Put/Append
calls).

<h3>Part B: Key/value service with snapshots <script>g("hard")</script></h3>

<p>
As things stand now, your key/value server doesn't call your Raft
library's <tt>Snapshot()</tt> method, so a rebooting server has to
replay the complete persisted Raft log in order to restore its state.
Now you'll modify kvserver to cooperate with Raft to save log space,
and reduce restart time, using Raft's <tt>Snapshot()</tt> from Lab 2D.

<p>
The tester passes <tt>maxraftstate</tt> to your
<tt>StartKVServer()</tt>. <tt>maxraftstate</tt> indicates the maximum
allowed size of your persistent Raft state in bytes (including the
log, but not including snapshots). You should
compare <tt>maxraftstate</tt> to <tt>persister.RaftStateSize()</tt>.
Whenever your key/value server detects that the Raft state size is
approaching this threshold, it should save a snapshot
by calling Raft's <tt>Snapshot</tt>.
If <tt>maxraftstate</tt> is
-1, you do not have to snapshot.
<tt>maxraftstate</tt> applies to the GOB-encoded
bytes your Raft passes to <tt>persister.SaveRaftState()</tt>.

<p class="todo">
Modify your kvserver so that it detects when the persisted Raft state
grows too large, and then hands a snapshot to Raft.  When a kvserver
server restarts, it should read the snapshot from <tt>persister</tt>
and restore its state from the snapshot.

<ul class="hints">
<li>
Think about when a kvserver should snapshot its state
and what should be included in the snapshot. Raft
stores each snapshot in the persister object using
<tt>SaveStateAndSnapshot()</tt>,
along with corresponding Raft state.
You can read the
latest stored snapshot using <tt>ReadSnapshot()</tt>.
<li>
Your kvserver must be able to detect
duplicated operations in the log across checkpoints, so any
state you are using to detect them must be included in
the snapshots.
<li>Capitalize all fields of structures stored in the snapshot.
<li>You may have bugs in your Raft library that this lab exposes.  If
  you make changes to your Raft implementation make sure it continues
  to pass all of the Lab 2 tests.
<li>
A reasonable amount of time to take for the Lab 3 tests is 400 seconds
of real time and 700 seconds of CPU time. Further,
<tt>go test -run TestSnapshotSize</tt> should take less than 20
seconds of real time.
</ul>

<p>
Your code should pass the 3B tests (as in the example here) as well
as the 3A tests (and your Raft must continue to pass the Lab 2 tests).
<pre>
$ go test -run 3B -race
Test: InstallSnapshot RPC (3B) ...
