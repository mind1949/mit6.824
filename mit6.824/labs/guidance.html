<h1>Lab guidance</h1>

<h2>Hardness of assignments</h2>
  
<p>Each task indicates how difficult it is:
  <ul>
    <li><p><span class="easy">Easy</span>: A few hours.</li>
    <li><p><span class="moderate">Moderate</span>: ~ 6 hours (per week).</li>
    <li><p><span class="hard">Hard</span>: More than 6 hours (per week). If
    you start late, your solution is unlikely to pass all tests.</li>
  </ul>
  These times are rough estimates of our expectations.
  
<p>The tasks in general require not many lines of code (a
few hundred lines), but the code is conceptually complicated and often
  details matter a lot.  Some of the tests are difficult to pass.

<div class="important">
<p>Don't start a lab the night before it is due; it's much
more time efficient to do the labs in several sessions spread over
multiple days. Tracking down bugs in distributed system code is
difficult, because of concurrency, crashes, and an unreliable network.
Problems often require thought and careful debugging to understand and fix.

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Do the <a href="http://tour.golang.org/">Online Go tutorial</a> and
  consult
  <a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">How to write Go
    code</a>.
    See <a href="https://golang.org/doc/editors.html">Editors</a> to
    set up your editor for Go.
  
<li>Use Go's <a href="https://blog.golang.org/race-detector">race detector</a>, with <tt>go build -race</tt> and <tt>go
    run -race</tt>.  Fix any races it reports.


<li>Read this <a href="https://thesquareplanet.com/blog/students-guide-to-raft/">guide</a>
  for Raft specific advice.

<li>Advice on <a href="raft-locking.txt">locking</a> in labs.

<li>Advice on <a href="raft-structure.txt">structuring</a> your Raft lab.

<li>
This <a href="../notes/raft_diagram.pdf">Diagram of Raft interactions</a> may
help you understand code flow
between different parts of the system.

<li>It may be helpful when debugging
to insert print statements when a
peer sends or receives a message, and collect the output in a file
with
<tt>go test -race &gt; out</tt>.  Then, by studying the trace of
messages in the <tt>out</tt> file, you can identify where your
implementation deviates from the desired behavior.

<li>Structure your debug messages in a consistent
format so that you can use <tt>grep</tt> to search for specific
lines in <tt>out</tt>.

<li>You might find <tt>DPrintf</tt> useful instead of
  calling <tt>log.Printf</tt> directly to turn printing on and off as
  you debug different problems.

<li>You can use formatting options like colors or columns to make 
    understanding the log output easier.
    <a href="https://blog.josejg.com/debugging-pretty/">This post</a> explains 
    how to build a tool that labels logs with topics and
    then pretty prints the logs using colorized terminal output with
    separate columns for each server.

<li> To learn more about git, look at the
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git book</a> or the

<h2>Debugging as a formal process</h2>

<p>Debugging complex concurrent systems is not magic. Debugging is a
science and a skill, and it can be learned and practiced. When done
well, debugging is a process that will lead you inerringly from an
initial observation of an error back to the exact fault that caused
that error. In general, most bugs in complex systems cannot be solved
using ad-hoc or "guess-and-check" approaches; you are likely to have
the most success by being as methodical in your approach as possible.

<p>Helpful definitions:

<ul><li>A <b>fault</b> is an underlying cause of a bug. This is the
mistake in a piece of code that allows for something to go wrong. They
can be anything from a typo to a fundamental misunderstanding of a
protocol that is enshrined in your code.

<li>An <b>error</b> is a deviation at a particular point in time
between the theoretical correct state of a program and the actual state
of the program at that time. An error is either a latent error, an
observable error, or a masked error.

<ul>
<li>A <b>latent error</b> is not visible to you; it is silently
propagating within your code. It will eventually become an observable
error or a masked error.

<li>An <b>observable error</b> is visible; it has been <b>surfaced</b>
in the observable output of the program, either as an error message, an
unexpected output, or the lack of an expected output.

<li>A <b>masked error</b> is where wherein some property of the
implementation or design allows a previous latent error to be ignored.
For example, if a log entry is incorrectly added in Raft (a latent
error), but then overwritten later by a correct entry before it is
reported anywhere, the original error has been masked and can never
become observable.

</ul>

<li><b>Instrumentation</b> refers to the parts of your code that report
on the current state of your program. This includes both code to
explicitly detect particular possible errors, and code to print out
state so that it can later be manually examined to see whether or not
it indicates the presence of any errors.

</ul>

<p>You can debug forwards (from fault to error), or backwards (from
error to fault). The forward approach tends to devolve into a
"guess-and-check" approach, and frequently does not allow for
consistent or repeatable progress. By contrast, the backwards approach
is always applicable to the 6.824 labs, and allows for making
consistent progress, so we will focus on it here.

<p>The backwards approach is always applicable for our labs because you
always have an observable error to start with: the test cases
themselves function as a form of instrumentation, which will detect
certain kinds of errors and surface them to you.

<h3>Working backwards to find an error</h3>

<p>The execution of a program that you are debugging can generally be
to have three phases:

<ol><li>The phase in which the execution of the program is correct and
error-free. A fault may exist in the program, but it has not yet been
manifested as an actual error.

<li>The phase in which a fault has manifested, and has produced one or
more latent errors in the program state. These are not yet visible, and
may silently propagate within the program state.

<li>The phase in which the latent errors have surfaced, and become
observable errors. At this point, you have an indication that there's
something wrong with the running program.

</ol>

<p>The goal of debugging is to narrow in on the exact location of the
fault within your implementation. This means you need to identify the
point in time when the fault is manifested, and the program moves from
phase 1 to phase 2. It's hard to find the exact extent of phase 1,
because it is generally prohibitively difficult to analyze the complete
state of a program in sufficient detail to be certain that a fault has
not yet manifested itself at any point in time.

<p>Instead, the best approach is usually to work backwards and narrow
down the size of phase 2 until it is as small as possible, so that the
location of the fault is readily apparent. This is done by expanding
the instrumentation of your code to surface errors sooner, and thereby
spend less time in phase 2. This generally involves adding additional
debugging statements and/or assertions to your code.

<h3>Making progress</h3>

<p>When adding instrumentation, you want to focus on making clear and
deliberate progress at narrowing down the cause of the fault. You
should identify the first observable error you can in your debugging
output, and then attempt to narrow down the most proximate cause of
that error. This is done by forming a hypothesis about what the most
proximate cause of the error could be, and then adding instrumentation
to test that hypothesis. If your hypothesis is true, then you have a
new "first observable error" and can repeat the process. If false,
then you must come up with a new hypothesis about the proximate cause
and test that instead.

<p>It's important to maintain a sense of exactly what your current
first observable error is, as you move backwards, so that you don't get
lost among other errors that may be observable in your output.

<p>At the beginning, you don't know anything about where the fault
could be; it could be anywhere in your entire program. But as you
advance, the possible interval in which the fault could be will narrow,
until you reach a single line of code that must contain the fault. When
you're down to the execution of a single function or a single block of
code, it can be helpful to use a "bisection" approach, where you
repeatedly add instrumentation halfway through the interval, and narrow
down to one half or the other. (This is like binary search, but for
finding bugs.)

<h3>Adding instrumentation</h3>

<p>As a debugger, your main challenge is to pick the best locations for
your instrumentation to best narrow down the location of your fault,
along with deciding the most useful pieces of information to report in
that piece of instrumentation. You can and should use your knowledge of
your implementation to speed this up, but you must always check your
assumptions by actually running your code and observing the results of
your instrumentation.


<p>Because instrumentation is so essential to your debugging process,
you should take the time to design and implement it carefully. Consider
some of the following questions when designing your instrumentation:

<ul><li>How much detail do you need from your instrumentation? Either
in general, or just for the current step in your debugging process?
How can you make it easier to adjust the level of detail and the main
focus of your instrumentation? Can you turn on or off different pieces
of debugging without deleting them from your code?

<p>(In particular, consider using an approach like the provided DPrintf
function does, and defining one or more constant boolean flags to turn
on or off different aspects of your instrumentation.)

<li>How can you optimize your own ability to quickly read and
understand what your instrumentation is indicating? Can you use text
colors, columns, consistent formats, codewords, or symbols to make it
easier to read?

<p>The best approach will be personalized to the particular way that
YOU best percieve information, so you should experiment to find out
what works well for you.

<li>How can you enhance your own ability to add instrumentation? Can
you use existing tools (like the go "log" package) to help?
(I recommend turning on the Lmicroseconds flag, if you do.)

<p>Can you build your own helper functions, so that a common set of
data (current server, term, and role, perhaps?) will always be
displayed?

</ul>

<p>One specific note: make sure to learn about format strings if you
aren't already familiar with them. You can refer to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string">Wikipedia
article on Printf format strings</a>, or to the
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/">Go-specific documentation</a>.
You will likely be much happier using functions like 'log.Printf' or
'fmt.Printf' than trying to achieve the same effects with multiple
print functions.

<p>You might also consider trying to condense each individual event you
report into a single line to facilitate your ability to scan output
quickly.

<h3>Tips on asking for help</h3>

As mentioned above, debugging is a complex and iterative process. It
can be hard for TAs to help you debug your code over Piazza; we
strongly encourage you to bring your difficult debugging challenges to
Office Hours instead! We will be happy to help walk you through the
debugging approaches that are best applicable to your situation. Of
course, you are likely to get the most mileage out of your time in
Office Hours if you make a significant attempt at debugging the problem
yourself in as methodical a manner as possible.

<h3>Tips on timeouts</h3>

<p>It should be noted that tweaking timeouts rarely fixes bugs, and
that doing so should be a last resort. We frequently see students
willing to keep making arbitrary tweaks to their code (especially
timeouts) rather than following a careful debugging process. Doing this
is a great way to obscure underlying bugs by masking them instead of
fixing them; they will often still show up in rare cases, even if they
appear fixed in the common case.

<p>In particular, in Raft, there are wide ranges of timeouts that will
let your code work. While you CAN pick bad timeout values, it won't
take much time to find timeouts that are functional.

<h3>Additional debugging tips</h3>

<ul><li><p>It's worth noting that there may be multiple faults in your
code! It is often easiest to narrow down a bug by focusing on the first
fault, rather than the last, because then there will be fewer errors in
the program state to consider.

<li><p>Try to avoid ruling out a bug in one piece of code simply because
you believe that it's correct. If you're dealing with a bug, that
usually implies that there's something wrong with your mental model of
your code -- either how your implementation actually works, or else
your understanding of how it's supposed to work. As such, you can't
rely too much on your mental model; always verify your assumptions.

<li><p>Debugging is a complex and multifaceted skill, and doing it well
takes discipline and clear consideration. Try to think carefully about
why your debugging approaches are succeeding or failing (or even just
being convenient or painful), and take the time to find and explore new
approaches that may help you. Time invested now in improving your
debugging knowledge will pay off well in later labs.

<li><p>Making premature fixes are often dangerous when debugging. They may
or may not solve the issue you're locking at, and are just as likely to
shift the exact location and presentation of the fault you're trying to
track down. Even worse, they may simply mask the real fault, rather
than solve it. Wait until you're confident about the exact fault
causing your observable error before you attempt a fix.

<li><p>Sometimes, making a fix doesn't immediately solve all of your
problems. Sometimes, the same test case still fails, because the old
fault was corrected, and a new fault that was previously hidden is now
visible.

<li><p>Don't neglect the possibility of bugs in your glue code. Elements
like main loops, locks, and channel I/O may seem simple and unlikely to
be wrong, but they can sometimes hide extremely challenging bugs.

<li><p>When possible, consider writing your code to "fail loudly". Instead
of trying to tolerate unexpected states, try to explicitly detect
states that should never be allowed to happen, and immediately report
these errors. Consider even immediately calling the Go 'panic' function
in these cases to fail especially loudly. See also the Wikipedia page
on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_programming">
Offensive programming</a> techniques. Remember that the longer you
allow errors to remain latent, the longer it will take to narrow down
the true underlying fault.

<li><p>When dealing with a bug that occurs sporadically, the best approach
is usually to log aggressively and dump the output to a file. It's
easier to filter out irrelevant parts of a verbose log (such as with a
separate script) than it is to wait for the error to reappear after N
runs.

<li><p>When you're failing a test, and it's not obvious why, it's usually
worth taking the time to understand what the test is actually doing,
and which part of the test is observing the problem. It can be helpful
to add print statements to the test code so that you know when events
are happening.

<li><p>And one last note: locking strategy matters. A lack of races
reported by the race detector does not indicate that your locking
strategy is correct. In particular, fine-grained locks can be
dangerous, because they can introduce more changes for interleaving.
</ul>

Happy debugging!
